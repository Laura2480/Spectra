<p>From the observer's point of view, the patients' thinking process appears to be slowed down (objective). As a result of this slow thought process, the conversation is languid and sluggish.</p>

<p class="bold">Different phenomena:</p>
<p>
    Inhibited thinking (i)<br>
    Poverty of speech (0)
</p>

<p class="bold">Evaluation:</p>
<p>0 = not present<br>
1 = doubtful: a possible slowed down thought process; however, the flow of the conversation or exploration is not affected<br>
2 = mild: examiner notes slow thought process and flow of conversation or exploration is slightly affected<br>
3 = moderate: examiner notes slow thought process and flow of conversation or exploration is considerably limited<br>
4 = severe: due to the slow train of thoughts of the patient and the long pauses in the conversation, the flow of the conversation is so limited that an exploration is not possible or only proceeds with great effort</p>
