<p>
    A pattern of speech in which sounds, rather than meaningful relationships, appear to govern word choice, so that the intelligibility of the speech is impaired and redundant words are introduced.
    In addition to rhyming relationships, this pattern of speech may also include punning associations, so that a word similar in sound (polysemy/homophony) brings in a new thought.

<p>0 = not present<br>
    1 = doubtful <br>
    2 = mild: Clanging occurs several times during the interview.<br>
    3 = moderate: Clanging occurs occasionally during the interview. The exploration is not significantly limited.<br>
    4 = severe: Clanging occurs frequently and largely dominates the conversation. As a result, the exploration is considerably hindered.
