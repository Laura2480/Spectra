<p>
    Restriction in the range of content, adherence to one topic or a few topics,
    or fixation on a few key ideas. During the conversation, the patient experiences
    difficulties in switching from one topic to another, or constantly returns to the initial topic.
    For a successful exploration, it is necessary that the examiner offers the patient a variety of topics.
    This is important since the topic of illness always forms part of a psychiatric exploration,
    but this should not automatically be treated as resulting from Restricted Thinking.
    When exploring the topic of illness, it is only possible to refer to Restricted Thinking when
    the patient is fixed on single aspects of his illness, and when he is not able to detach
    from these aspects despite being offered other topics of discussion (e.g. a depressive patient
    who is preoccupied with his indigestion).

<p class="bold">Evaluation:</p>
<p>
    0 = not present<br>
    1 = doubtful: The patient returns to one topic a few times.<br>
    2 = mild: The patient sticks to a few topics, so that a conversation about other topics is fairly difficult.<br>
    3 = moderate: The patient is constrained to just a few topics. A conversation about other subjects is almost impossible. The patient has to exert effort in order to change the topic.<br>
    4 = severe: The patient sticks to one specific idea. Although other topics are offered, he constantly and immediately returns to the same idea.<br>
