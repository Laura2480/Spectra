<p>The patient is constantly occupied with mostly unpleasant topics. These thoughts are centered around the same topics without leading to any conclusions. It is difficult for the patient to interrupt these negative thought processes. Rumination is experienced as unpleasant and in some cases even tortuous.</p>

<p class="bold">Different phenomena:</p>
<p>
    Narrow thinking (0)<br>
    Poverty of thought (s)
</p>

<p class="bold">Evaluation:</p>
<p>
    0 = not present<br>
    1 = doubtful<br>
    2 = mild: rumination occurs and patient is mildly affected but still able to handle daily responsibilities<br>
    3 = moderate: the patient is disturbed by his ruminations. His day-to-day responsibilities and well-being are affected<br>
    4 = severe: the patient is greatly tormented by his ruminations. His daily responsibilities and well-being are severely compromised

    <span class="bold">BERT</span>, is an advanced language model developed in the field of artificial intelligence. He has been trained on a large body of text to develop a deep understanding of the semantic and syntactic relationships within words and sentences.
    <span class="bold">BERT</span> represents words contextually, considering the surrounding context in which it appears.
</p>
<p>
    The concept of <span class="bold">similarity</span> in the context of <span class="bold">BERT</span> refers to the ability to evaluate how semantically similar two pieces of text are.
    In other words, <span class="bold">BERT</span> can calculate how much two sentences share similar information or represent related concepts.
    This ability comes from its contextual understanding of words: if two sentences share similar keywords or grammatical structures, <span class="bold">BERT</span> will be able to identify that similarity.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, <span class="bold">BERT</span> evaluates the similarity between sentences by calculating a sort of "similarity score".
    This score reflects how much the sentences overlap in terms of meaning.
    For example, if two sentences deal with the same topic or express similar concepts,
    <span class="bold">BERT</span> will assign them a higher similarity score. This process is of great use in many applications, such as information retrieval, semantic search, and context understanding in search engines and natural language processing systems.
</p>
<p>
    However, the potential of <span class="bold">BERT</span> goes beyond similarity assessment. One notable application is <span class="bold">sentiment analysis</span>.
    Here, <span class="bold">BERT</span> demonstrates his ability to understand not only the literal meaning of words, but also the emotional undertones they carry.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, <span class="bold">BERT</span> uses its contextual understanding of language not only to assess similarity between texts, but also for <span class="bold">sentiment analysis</span>.
    This skill opens up a wide range of applications, from advanced natural language processing to creating
    tools that can understand and respond to the nuances of human emotion expressed through text.
