<p>
    A pattern of spontaneous speech in which ideas slip “off the track” onto other thoughts which are clearly but obliquely related. Things may be said in juxtaposition which lack a meaningful relationship, or the patient may shift idiosyncratically from one frame of reference to another. At times there may be vague connections between the ideas. The objective characteristic of Derailment should be coded as if the interviewer were talking to the patient for the first time (unaware of potential personal associative connections between the thoughts).
    One manifestation of this disorder is a slow steady slippage, with no single Derailment being particularly severe, so that the speaker gets farther and farther off the track with each Derailment without any awareness that his reply no longer has any connection to the question being asked.

<p class="bold">Different phenomena:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dissociation of Thinking (o)</li>
    <li>Tangentiality (o)</li>
    <li>Circumstantiality (o)</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Evaluation:</p>
<p>0 = not present<br>
    1 = doubtful: Connections between the sentences are still obvious. Overall, the thoughts have a connection to what has been said before.<br>
    2 = moderate: Connections are still obvious but are sometimes not directly related to what has been said before.<br>
    3 = severe: The patient slides slowly from one idea to another without any meaningful connection between them. He stops at a peripheral association or a thematically irrelevant aspect of the sentence, and doesn’t conclude his line of thought.<br>
    4 = extreme: The interview is incomprehensible.
