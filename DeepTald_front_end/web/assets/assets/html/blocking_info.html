<p>
    Perceived and reported blocking of an ongoing line of thought, also known as “losing one’s train of thought”. Blocking is subjectively noticed by the patient. Included is the phenomenon of “Fading”, which refers to a slow dimming away of a thought, as opposed to a sudden termination (in the sense of “Rupture of Thought,” Item 1). Fading can also occur in a fluctuating manner, which means that the thought becomes weaker at first, then becomes clearer again, then fades away once more.  In contrast to a loss of thought, Fading can only be assessed if the patient himself reports this phenomenon.
    Blocking and Fading may occur either with or without Thought Interference (Item 22, infiltration of a new thought)

<p class="bold">Different phenomena:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rupture of Thought (o)</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Evaluation:</p>
<p>0 = not present<br>
    1 = doubtful <br>
    2 = mild: The patient reports several occurrences of Blocking. The patient must not feel impaired as a result.<br>
    3 = moderate: The patient reports occasional Blocking. It is possible that the patient suffers due to Blocking and/or that communication is slightly impaired from his point of view.<br>
    4 = severe: The patient reports frequent Blocking. It is required that the patient suffers due to Blocking and/or that communication is impaired from his point of view.
