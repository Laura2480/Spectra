Certainly! Here's a revised version of your README that minimizes excessive citations of the `AlphaPose` and `MotionBERT` documentation, focuses on providing clear guidance, and highlights the availability of dedicated notebooks for executing individual tasks. The README is entirely in English as requested.

# SPECTRA Motion Module

## Overview

The **SPECTRA Motion Module** is designed to analyze users' gait patterns by leveraging advanced human pose estimation and motion representation techniques. It integrates [AlphaPose](http://www.mvig.org/research/alphapose.html) for extracting 2D keypoints from video data and utilizes **MotionBERT**, a transformer-based architecture, to classify and extract meaningful embeddings from these keypoints. This combination enables comprehensive analysis of human motion for applications such as surveillance, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction.

## Features

- **Accurate Pose Estimation**: Utilizes AlphaPose for precise multi-person 2D keypoint extraction.
- **Advanced Motion Representation**: Employs MotionBERT to generate rich motion embeddings from extracted keypoints.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with both Linux and Windows operating systems.


This project builds upon and acknowledges the foundational works in the field of human pose estimation and motion representation. Key references include:
