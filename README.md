## Overview

**SPECTRA** (Supporting Schizophrenia Patients Care with Artificial Intelligence) is a project funded by the PNRR aimed at providing advanced diagnostic analysis tools for psychiatrists. Utilizing cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, SPECTRA supports the early diagnosis of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS).

### Project Objectives

1. **Language**: Analyze and process linguistic data to identify language markers associated with TRS.
2. **Motion**: Analyze movement data to detect motor anomalies related to TRS.
3. **Brain Structure**: Utilize neuroimaging to identify structural brain abnormalities.
4. **Emotional Response**: Evaluate emotional responses through physiological signals.
